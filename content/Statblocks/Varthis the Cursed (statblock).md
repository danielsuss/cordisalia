### Traits

**Spellcasting.** Varthis is a 5th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). Varthis has the following wizard spells prepared:

- Cantrips (at will): chill touch, mage hand, prestidigitation
- 1st level (4 slots): mage armor, magic missile, ray of sickness
- 2nd level (3 slots): blindness/deafness, ray of enfeeblement
- 3rd level (2 slots): animate dead, vampiric touch

**Undead Thralls.** When Varthis casts animate dead, he can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate.

### Actions

**Dagger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.

**Necrotic Touch (Recharge 5-6).** Varthis touches a creature within reach. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 22 (4d8 + 3) necrotic damage, and Varthis regains hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt.

### Description

Varthis the Cursed wanders the shadowy corridors of his undercroft, surrounded by his macabre creations. With a mind as sharp as his dagger, he's spent decades mastering the dark arts, specifically the necromantic spells that allow him to bend death to his will. Although not physically imposing, his true power lies in his command over the dead and his ability to leech life from the living to sustain himself.
