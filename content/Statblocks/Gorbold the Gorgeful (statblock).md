### Description

Gorbold is a rarity among his kind, a gentle giant who prefers the company of the smaller folk and sharing stories over a pint. He's known to carry a magical barrel that never runs out of ale, which also has the ability to heal those who drink from it. Despite his kind demeanor, Gorbold can defend himself with mighty swings of his fists or by tossing barrels when necessary.
