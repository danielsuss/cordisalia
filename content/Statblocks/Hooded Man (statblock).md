### Description

Zephyr serves the shadow occult with a wicked glee, using his arcane abilities to thwart the enemies of his order. His magic blasts are tinged with a dark purple energy, and he can infuse his fists with the same arcane force to deliver powerful blows. Zephyr revels in the chaos he creates and is always ready to cast himself into darkness to escape or ambush his foes.
