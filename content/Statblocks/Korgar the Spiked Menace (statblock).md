### Traits

**Aggressive.** As a bonus action, Korgar can move up to his speed toward a hostile creature that he can see.

**Relentless Endurance (1/Long Rest).** When Korgar is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, he can drop to 1 hit point instead.

**Savage Attacks.** When Korgar scores a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, he can roll one of the weaponâ€™s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Korgar makes two melee attacks with his spiked greatclub.

**Spiked Greatclub.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Menacing Roar (Recharge 5-6).** Korgar lets out a fearsome roar. Each creature of his choice within 30 feet of him and aware of him must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Description

Korgar is a brute force, his body covered in tribal tattoos, and his choice weapon a massive, spike-encrusted greatclub. He has a reputation for his ferocity in battle and his intimidating presence. While not the sharpest tool in the shed, Korgar knows how to instill fear in his enemies and relishes the heat of combat.
