### Story Progression
- Deal with the [[Hooded Man (statblock)]] and make contact with the [[Circlet of the Occult]]
- Put [[Liri]] in a life or death situation to activate the shadow inside of her

### Plot 1 - The Hooded Man
- The gang can get his specific room from persuading [[Sarmon]] - he also tells them that he saw the man crouched over in the corners of the hallways looking shady while he was moving in
- He's in room 7, at the end of the hall
- Rigged the hallway with surveillance magic circles - if triggered he will blast the gang when they open his door
- if avoided - he will be on the floor meditating when they open the door
- when he uses a spell - causes him to wince in pain and blood to drip from his forehead where the gem of the circlet is
- blocks all the gangs attacks with magic skin, however this causes the blood to grow even more
- eventually he tries to teleport away - if brogan uses [[Aetherquartz Powder]], he successfully gets the teleport off, but winces in pain mid way, causing the teleport to shrink and cut off his feet - ring leads them to down by the river
- if brogan doesn't use the powder, he winces in pain causing the teleport to shrink and cut a hole in his stomach, causing him to die "The Occult is inevitable. The world as you know it will drown in shadow."
- just before he dies, the circlet grows bright pink, runes sprawl his body, and burns through and disintegrates his body, causing him to scream in pain
- the only thing that remains at the end is trousers, shoes, and the circlet
- damages to the inn mean that [[Sarmon]] is looking for payment or a favour

- Two weeks ago he went missing, was last seen entering [[Gloomstone Cavern]] along with two other men
- [[Kiara]] says that the real reason she wanted [[Ysgarlad]]'s help was to find [[Orson]]
- If whatever in the cavern was strong enough to get [[Orson]], her and her friend wouldn't be able to take it on alone
