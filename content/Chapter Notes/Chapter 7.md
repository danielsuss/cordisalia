### Norbert / Crystus
- depending on who they go to, they are told about the history of Rorkard
- Rorkard's been a quiet calm town for the best part of 20 years
- this thieves guild they ask about, there used to be one that run under the town, but it was disbanded years ago after the cruster guild took over the town
- since then rorkard hasn't seen much trouble, so its seen a decline in the number of warriors and mages being trained here, only a select few remain, the most notable of course being Orson
- The main entrance to the guild used to be down at the bottom of the town, but since then the river has filled up that space by means of erosion
### Sewers / Abandoned Thieves Guild
- make their way into the sewers some how, either woo liri and amara going in by the storm drain, or the whole gang going in at the bottom of the town
- rats and dampness in the sewers, long network
- as they walk along, they come to a big domelike room
- in the middle of the room there is a big statue, surrounded by a moat, the statue is rusted and black of a man, but his head has clearly been smashed off
- as they walk around the room, they find a desk with a bunch of pieces of paper on it
- the papers detail kiara's plan to summon morgrith to destroy the cruster guild and run rampant in rorkard - details about they will pay for what they did to father
- when i stumbled across their little hideout in gloomstone cavern, little did they know that morgrith would become the perfect part to my plan to destroy Rorkard
- she just needs to workout how to get past korgar, gorbold and varthis to draw the summoning circle
- details about how the more human flesh morgrith consumes the bigger and stronger she gets
- will test the summoning in Kalskog before trying it again in Rorkard, to see how long I can summon Morgrith for
### Kalskog

- Morgrith has run rampant through the village, they see the town in destruction
