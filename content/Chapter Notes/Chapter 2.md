#### Description of [[Tuskhoof]]

```
ROWENA:
	"This here's a special breed called a Tuskhoof, and we've been using them in this village for just about as long as its been around. Their size and extra muscularity makes a good fit for our strongly built men, and also allows for easier transport of our Lumber in large batches."

```

```

```
GRONK:

```
- Gronk yells looking in the direction of his horse, who is down drinking from the river, however a look of sadness falls upon him when his horse doesn't respond to his calls. He looks at Rowena with a jolt in his brow, who returns an unphased smug look.
