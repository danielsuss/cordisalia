As the gang forges ahead through the [[Verdant Forest]], three days pass without any form of conflict. However, a couple hours into the morning of day four this would all change.
```
???:
	HEEEEEELP! HEEEEEELP! SOMEBODY HELP!
```
The gang hears a male voice shouting for help coming from up ahead on the path. As they continue walking a figure of something dangling from a tree comes into sight.
```
???:
	HEEEEEEEEELP!
```
The shouting continues, and as they get closer, they realise that the shouts are coming from the dangling figure, which is actually man tied by his feet dangling upside down from a large tree. [[Woo Baby Woo|Woo]] remains cautious as ever, however [[Ysgarlad]] walks closer to inspect the situation, stopping next to the man.
```
???:
	Please man, you gotta help me! Please!
```
Ysgarlad reassures the man and tells him to calm down, and shoots a look over to [[Brogan Stone-Flask|Brogan]]. After taking a step back, [[Brogan Stone-Flask|Brogan]] leaps onto [[Ysgarlad]]'s shoulder, who in one strong motion launches [[Brogan Stone-Flask|Brogan]] towards the top of the rope like a shotput. [[Brogan Stone-Flask|Brogan]] slashes the rope with his axe, and due to [[Ysgarlad]]'s overwhelming strength lands face first in a hedge behind the tree. The man, a gnome, stands up in front of [[Ysgarlad]] and brushes the dirt off his shoulders. [[Ysgarlad]] peers down at the man who is only three and a half feet tall.

```
???:
	Thank you for your kindness!
```
The gnome nods and thanks [[Brogan Stone-Flask|Brogan]] and [[Ysgarlad]] before continuing.
```
???:
	The names Hoagle, I'm a travelling trader. I'll tell ya how I ended up in this situation. Last night I was walkin along this here path, gettin a bit dark, I probably shoulda stopped to rest. Before I knew it whoooooosh! I'm swept off my feet, danglin from that tree. All of a sudden these- Kobolds- about two and a half foot tall, they come out from behind the bushes, cacklin, speakin some foreign language! They come right at me, swipe my bag, cackle some more, and then they just walked off and left me danglin!
```
[[Hoagle]] pauses and looks at each member of the gang. He seems like he has realised something.
```
Hoagle:
	Please guys, you gotta help me get my bag back! That's my whole career in there! you gotta help me get it back please you gotta understan-
```
[[Ysgarlad]] interrupts [[Hoagle]] and tells him to calm down, to take a breather. [[Ysgarlad]] discusses with the rest of the gang what to do. [[Woo Baby Woo|Woo]] seems disinterested in helping the gnome, but after a brief back and forth, they go back to speak with [[Hoagle]]. [[Ysgarlad]] asks if there will be a reward for their help.
```
Hoagle:
	Why of course! What do I look like to you? A goblin? Please, some respect. If you help me out, I'll give you each an item from my stock for free.
```
[[Brogan Stone-Flask|Brogan]] asks [[Hoagle]] how he expects them to find the [[Kobold|Kobolds]]. [[Hoagle]] sticks out his hand for the gang to see and starts wiggling his fingers. On one of them is a silver ring with an encrusted blue gem. He holds out his other hand, in which is a small black pouch with a fine bright blue powder inside.
```
Hoagle:
	This here's an aetherquartz ring! When I cast the incantation, it'll point along the same line of travel as the last clump of aethquartz powder that touched my skin. You see, just before the Kobolds left, I threw some powder on them without them noticin. 
```
[[Hoagle]] takes a second to cast the incantation, after which, a small glowing blue circle appears in the gem of the ring. It spins around the circumference of the gem, before settling at a spot on the edge.
```
Hoagle:
	See! Looks like they went that way!
```
The ring appears to point in the same direction as the path towards [[Rorkard]]. [[Brogan Stone-Flask|Brogan]] stops [[Hoagle]] before they proceed, and states that they'll only help [[Hoagle]] get his bag back if he can wear the ring. After some back and forth [[Hoagle]] agrees to [[Brogan Stone-Flask|Brogan]]'s terms and hands over the ring. Fits like a glove, and so the gang sets off with [[Brogan Stone-Flask|Brogan]] at the lead. After about two hours of walking, the ring points in a different direction; to the left across the [[River Midwood]].

Peering over the river from the bank on the right, the gang sees some rustling in the vegetation, but can't make out any clear figures. Realising crossing over is inevitable, [[Ysgarlad]] looks towards [[Brogan Stone-Flask|Brogan]] and smiles. Deja vu? Long of the short of it, [[Ysgarlad]] tries to throw [[Brogan Stone-Flask|Brogan]] across, but he slips mid throw and [[Brogan Stone-Flask|Brogan]] ends up in the drink, unentertained. [[Ysgarlad]] turns to [[Hoagle]] to throw him across as well.
```
Hoagle:
	Actually man.. I think I'm gonna stay over here. You guys look like you got this all undah control. Those lizards give me the heeby jeebies if ya know what im sayin'.
```
[[Ysgarlad]] shoots the gnome a stern look, who in turn backs himself onto a tree and makes it very clear that he doesn't want to move. Nevertheless, [[Ysgarlad]] parkours across the stones on to the left bank. As [[Brogan Stone-Flask|Brogan]] pulls himself up onto the island in the middle of the river, [[Woo Baby Woo|Woo]] hops across elegantly to the same point. Collecting themselves, they notice a strange line of sticks, stretching across the small landmass. Upon further inspection, they see a pair of red stones connected to either end of the sticks. [[Ysgarlad]] seems interested in what they're doing and starts shouting across the river.
```
Ysgarlad:
	OI- OOOIII! WHAS THA? WHAT YOU GUYS DOING?! WHA YOU LOOKIN AT?! OI-
```
[[Woo Baby Woo|Woo]] and [[Brogan Stone-Flask|Brogan]] debate throwing one of the red rocks at [[Ysgarlad]] to shut up his yapping, but realize that its probably a trap. They carefully step over the sticks, and jump across to [[Ysgarlad]] on the other side of the river, warning him to watch his step and tread lightly. [[Ysgarlad]] tells them not to worry, and points towards the rustling vegetation with a grin and a glint in his eye. Before anyone can say anything he charges full speed! After about 10 feet he is somehow flying through the air, his trajectory headed straight for the grass! A carefully strung tripwire caught him mid stride, causing trees to shake from which birds crow and scatter. The clashing of [[Ysgarlad|Ysgarlad's]] armour is loud as he crashes into the ground, landing flat, face down. Just as [[Brogan Stone-Flask|Brogan]] and [[Woo Baby Woo|Woo]] look at the knight on the floor in second hand embarrassment, they find a barrage of small stones flying fast in their direction. Managing to avoid the projectiles unscathed, they hear high pitched cackling coming from the same direction. They see four scaly figures, each about 3 foot tall.
![[Pasted image 20240419204723.png]]
Its the [[Kobold|Kobolds]]! Three of them start walking towards the gang menacingly, whirling their slings around, loaded ready with more stones.
![[Pasted image 20240419204736.png]]
The last one has wings, and is standing next to the body of a [[Boar]] that looks like it was killed pretty recently. It picks up a heavy rock from nearby and takes flight towards the gang.
